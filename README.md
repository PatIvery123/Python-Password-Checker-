# Python Password Checker

## Objective
Developed a Python-based Password Strength Checker to evaluate password security, implementing criteria such as length, character diversity, and common pattern detection, to help enhance password security best practices


## Steps Taken
1. **Set Up Python Environment**: Installed Python and created a new project file.
2. **Define Password Criteria**: Established checks for length, character types, and special characters.
3. **Implement Regular Expressions**: Used regex to validate uppercase, lowercase, digits, and special characters.
4. **Check for Common Patterns**: Verified passwords against known weak patterns (e.g., "123456").
5. **Create Evaluation Function**: Built a function to assess password strength based on the criteria.
6. **Test and Validate**: Run tests on various passwords to ensure the checker functions correctly.
